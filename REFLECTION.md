\# Reflection



\## What patterns or surprises did you notice?

Building each function showed a pattern: most of them are small, single purpose helpers that become more useful when combined. I also noticed how quickly tests reveal mistakes, even when the code looks right.



\## What logic challenged your thinking?

The biggest challenge was making sure each function handled input consistently and thinking through edge cases like negative numbers or zero.



\## How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?

A toolkit like this can be reused across projects for validation and quick calculations. In larger codebases, small utility functions reduce repeated code and make programs easier to read and maintain.
